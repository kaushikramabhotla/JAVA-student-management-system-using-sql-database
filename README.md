This project is basically a student-teacher management system using sql database . Only backend/(terminal output)


I used sql server application for this project to prepare the tables required
IDE - Intellij Idea


                Steps : 
               1. CREATE CONNECTION CLASS
               
               2. CALL THAT IN MAIN METHOD
               
               3. FOR INSERTION OF VALUES INTO DATABASE, USE PREPARED STATEMENT, INITIATE CONNECTION,PS.SETSTRING/INT AS YOU WISH!.
               
               4. FOR READING DB DATA, USE RESULT SET CLASS AND STATEMENT CLASS AND RESULTSET.GETSTRING METHOS.
               
               5. CATCH THE EXCEPTIONS(MOSTLY 'SQLException' AND 'NullPointerException'.
               
               6. CLOSE ALL CONNECTIONS INCLUDING PREPARED STATEMENTS AND RESULT SETS WHEREVER NECESSARY.
               
               7. THAT'S IT FOLKS :)
